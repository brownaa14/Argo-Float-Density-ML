The goal of this project is predicting global seawater density between 200 and 2000m of depth
All data is collected from the Argo program headed by UCSD. The Argo program has been deploying and maintaining over 4,000 "floats" containing a wide array of sensors to measure 92 physical and chemical parameters in ocean waters since the early 2000s. These floats are deployed in the ocean and drift in its currents while taking measurements from the surface all the way down to 6000m of depth.

The primary variables of interest in this analysis are the ocean's temperature, salinity, pressure (used to measure depth), and the sensors' latitude and longitude coordinates. The response variable is going to be density, the driver of ocean circulation, which is a function of both salinity and temperature.

Insights about the flow of ocean currents from this analysis can be used to validate current oceanographic modeling techniques which are used heavy in weather, marine population, and marine transportation modeling.
